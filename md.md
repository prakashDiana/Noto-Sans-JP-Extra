You've defined `\deltaPercentage` as an operator displaying "$\Delta\%$".

The equation you provided is:
$$\def\deltaPercentage{\operatorname{\Delta\%}}\deltaPercentage \left(8, 7\right)=-12.5$$

This looks like a custom notation for **percentage change** (also known as percentage difference, percentage increase/decrease, or relative change).

Given the input values $(8, 7)$ and the output $-12.5$, the equation being represented is:

**Percentage Change Formula:**
$$\text{Percentage Change} = \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \times 100\%$$

In your specific example:
* **Old Value** (or reference value) = $8$
* **New Value** (or compared value) = $7$

Let's plug these into the formula:
$$\frac{7 - 8}{8} \times 100\% = \frac{-1}{8} \times 100\% = -0.125 \times 100\% = -12.5\%$$

So, the equation represented by your notation `\deltaPercentage(Old Value, New Value) = Result` is the **percentage change from the Old Value to the New Value.**
